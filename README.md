## Question 1 √

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

```swift

let colors = ["orange","red","yellow","turquoise","lavender"]
print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")

```

## Question 2 √

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

```swift
westernStates.popLast()
westernStates.popLast()

print(westernStates)
```

## Question 3 √

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

```swift

for s in moreStates {
    if s != "Hawaii" && s != "Alaska" {
        print("\(s): is in the continental United States")
    } else {
        print("\(s): is NOT in the continental United States")
    }
}

```


## Question 4 √

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

```swift

let trimString = myString.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces).count

```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

```swift 

for (_, value) in myFavoriteQuotes.enumerated() {
    let charNWCount = value.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "").count
        print(charNWCount)
}


```


## Question 5 √

Iterate through `garden` and place any 🌷 that you find into the `basket`. Replace any 🌷 that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many 🌷 are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt","dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
```swift
for (index,value) in garden.enumerated() where value == "🌷" {
    basket.append(value)
    garden[index] = "dirt"
}
print(basket)
print(garden)

```

## Question 6 √

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

```swift

battingLineup += ["Suzuki"]
battingLineup[1] = "Tejada"
battingLineup[5] = "Guerrero"
battingLineup.remove(at: 0)
battingLineup += ["Reyes"]
print(battingLineup)

```

## Question 7 √

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

```swift

for n in numbers {
if n == target {
print("found the target number \(target)")
}
}

```


## Question 8 √

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```swift
var maxNum = 0

for i in arrayOfNumbers where i > maxNum {
    maxNum = i
}
print(maxNum)

```


## Question 9 √

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```swift

var minNum = arrayOfNumbers.max()

for i in arrayOfNumbers where i < minNum! {
    minNum = i
}
print(minNum!)


```


## Question 10 √

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`

```swift 

for n in secondListOfNumbers where n % 2 == 1 {
    print(n)
}

```


## Question 11√

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```swift

let result = thirdListOfNumbers.reduce(0,+)

````


## Question 12 √

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```swift 

var sumOfEvens = 0

for n in thirdListOfNumbers {
    if n % 2 == 0 {
        sumOfEvens += n
    }
}
print(sumOfEvens)

```

## Question 13 √

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```

```swift

for i in listOne {
    for j in listTwo {
        if i == j {
            sharedElements.append(i)
        }
    }
}
print(sharedElements.count)


```


## Question 14 √

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```

```swift

for i in dupeFriendlyList where noDupeList.contains(i) == false {
    noDupeList.append(i)
}
print(noDupeList)


```

## Question 15 √

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

```swift

let sortArr = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
let secondSmNum = sortArr[1]
print(secondSmNum)

```

## Question 16 √

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```swift

var sum = 0
for i in 1..<1000 where i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
    sum += i
}
print(sum)

```

let dups = Dictionary(grouping: someRepeatsAgain, by: {$0}).filter { $1.count > 1 }.keys.sorted()
print(dups)

```

    for j in 1...tripleSumArr.count - 2 {
        for k in 2...tripleSumArr.count - 1 {
            if tripleSumArr[i] + tripleSumArr[j] + tripleSumArr[k] == 10 {
                print("\(tripleSumArr[i]) \(tripleSumArr[j]) \(tripleSumArr[k])")
                }
            }
        }
